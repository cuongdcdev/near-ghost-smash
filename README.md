# Ghost Smash

Ghost Smash is a type of whach-a-mole game where you catch ghost and earn score! 
Sometimes these ghosts will cast black magic on you so you can only see a dark screen but just keep catching them!  

My entry for js13k, the game size itself is 11kb, except the NEAR-SDK-JS part ^^ 



# How to play
